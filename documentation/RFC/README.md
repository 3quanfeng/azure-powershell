# Azure PowerShell RFC (Request For Comments)

This directory contains RFCs for the Azure PowerShell module.

The goal of RFCs is to collect early feedback on changes that the Azure PowerShell team is proposing to implement and allow anyone to propose changes.

While issues remain the primary mechanism to report bugs and feature requests we may see some features requests being transformed in RFC based on the magnitude of the change.
